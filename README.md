# Tablet Service Friend
A tool for one-click restarting the Wacom tablet service. Helpful when the driver craps out, loses pressure sensitivity and starts throwing the "Tablet driver not responding", "TABLET DRIVER WAS NOT FOUND" or similar errors. In most cases this is fixed by restarting the service, but since doing it manually is kind of a hassle I made this simple one button app.

While it obviates the need to reboot the PC, you still have to relaunch whatever painting/modelling software you were working in to regain pressure sensitivity. 

Tested on Windows 7 & 10, with both the "Consumer" and "Professional" Wacom drivers (versions 5.3.x.x and 6.3.x.x).
